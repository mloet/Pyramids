For this assignment, I personally added the texture mapping which consisted of...
1) Writing the texture_fn() that returned texture for a given surface and point on it
2) Refactoring code to use texture_fn()
3) Finding, loading, and assigning textures to objects from online images to use to project onto certain surfaces.
Overall, my partner worked on making the scene and I worked on making the textures that would be used by that scene.
